# AudioX

AudioX is an application that transcribes audio files and attempts to detect foul language in the audio.

## Prerequisites
In order to start using the application, there are certain requirements that are needed before starting the application. Because it uses technology from AWS, it requires some setup in order to get started.

The following requirements are as follows:
* pip (on terminal of your choice, so that the packages can be installed)
* AWS CLI (can be installed through pip)
* Access Key from AWS (for accessing S3 Bucket and Transcribe)
* AWS Account
* Amazon S3 Bucket (related to your AWS Account)
* Amazon Transcribe
* Repository cloned to local folder

Another thing is to make sure that the **Amazon S3 Bucket** and **Amazon Transcribe** remains empty, so to ensure no performance issue with the application itself.

## Setup
A virtual environment will be made in order to not tamper with other source files on the local computer. This will ease the use of the required packages for this application
